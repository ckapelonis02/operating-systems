# Project: Operating Systems

This project is part of the *Operating Systems* course.

Collaborated with [Christos Kostadimas](https://github.com/kChristos1) and [Dafni Papadaki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dafni-papadaki-605597266/) on this project.
They are both very good developers.

Our prof. Vasileios Samoladas has explained it very well [here](https://github.com/vsamtuc/tinyos3):

> TinyOS is a very small operating system, built on top of a simple-minded virtual machine, whose purpose is purely educational. It is not related in any way to the well-known operating system for wireless sensors, but since it was first conceived in 2003, there was a name collision that I have not yet resolved. This code (in its long history) has been used for many years to teach the Operating Systems course at the Technical University of Crete.

Huge thanks to him!

Our only contribution was to:
- make it work for Multithreading
- implement the Multilevel Feedback Queue Algorithm for the thread scheduling
- implement Pipes
- implement Sockets
